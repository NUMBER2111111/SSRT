## What Was Removed

1. ✅ All GitHub repository links
2. ✅ All "View Source" buttons
3. ✅ All "View Code" buttons
4. ✅ All source code download options
5. ✅ MIT License references (changed to Proprietary)
6. ✅ Open source indicators

## What Remains (Safe)

1. ✅ **Legal documents mention "source code"** - This is CORRECT
   - They state: "You cannot access source code"
   - This is protective legal language, not exposure

2. ✅ **HOSTING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md mentions GitHub** - This is CORRECT
   - Only mentions GitHub as a deployment option
   - No links to your repository
   - Just documentation about hosting options

3. ✅ **iOS project file has "sourcecode.swift"** - This is CORRECT
   - This is Xcode's internal file type identifier
   - Not a user-facing reference
   - Standard Xcode project structure

---

## ✅ FINAL VERDICT

**ALL SOURCE CODE HAS BEEN REMOVED. NO SECRETS REVEALED.**

- No public source code links
- No GitHub repositories exposed
- No download links for source
- Proprietary license enforced everywhere
- Legal documents protect IP (not expose it)

**Your intellectual property is protected.**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Ready for deployment
